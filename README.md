## 🤔 What Is This?

Welcome to **REPOMAN** 🚗💨 — a test repository for people who aren't afraid to get into tense situations. Otto took back cars from people who didn't pay their bills. We take back code that doesn't meet standards. 😎

This repo exists to **test**, **break**, **fix**, and **reposess** things. Think of it as a '64 Chevy Malibu with something glowing in the trunk. 🛸✨ You don't wanna look in there.

## 🚗 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repo like you're hotwiring a Malibu
git clone https://github.com/plethoraofpinatas/repoman.git

# Get in the car. Put your seatbelt on.
# Lite don't ride with anybody who don't wear their seatbelt.
cd repoman

## 📋 The Rules

Bud taught us everything we know. Here's how we operate:

🚗 **Rule 1:** Always be ready to repo. 3am? 4am? Doesn't matter. Real repo men don't sleep.

🔫 **Rule 2:** Dress like a detective. Look square. People think you're packing something. Credibility matters.

💰 **Rule 3:** Credit is a sacred trust. You break the build? You owe the team.

🧊 **Rule 4:** Stay cool. You get into five or six tense situations a day, eventually it don't mean anything anymore.

💀 **Rule 5:** Only fools get taken out over a car. Or a merge conflict. Walk away if you have to.

## 🌌 The Lattice of Coincidence

```
    You're thinking about a plate of shrimp 🍤
    
    Someone says "plate" 🍽️
    Or "shrimp" 🦐
    Or "plate of shrimp" 🍤🍽️
    
    Out of the blue. No explanation.
    No point in looking for one either.
    
    It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. 🌌
    
    Same thing happens with bugs.
    You're thinking about a bug 🐛
    Someone files one 📝
    Someone else already fixed it 🔧
    
    ✨ It's the lattice, man. ✨
```

## ⚠️ WARNINGS

🛸 **DO NOT** open the trunk. Seriously.

💥 People sometimes just explode. Natural causes. Don't worry about it.

🧠 If your mind feels full to bursting one day and empty the next — that's the repo life, baby.

🚫 No commies in this repo. No Christians either. Bud's rules, not ours.

## 🎸 Soundtrack for Coding

You can't repo without the right tunes. Crank these while you commit:

```
🎵 Iggy Pop - TV Eye
🎵 Black Flag - TV Party
🎵 Circle Jerks - Coup d'Etat
🎵 Suicidal Tendencies - Institutionalized
🎵 Fear - Let's Have a War
🎵 Burning Sensations - Pablo Picasso
```

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

```
    Duke: "I blame society."
    
    Otto: "That's BS. You're a white suburban 
           punk just like me."
    
    Duke: "...yeah, but it still hurts."
    
    ─── Same energy as blaming the framework ───
    
    🧑‍💻 "The tests failed because of the CI."
    🧓 "That's BS. You didn't write tests."
    🧑‍💻 "...yeah, but it still hurts." 😢
```

## 📜 License

This repo operates under the same philosophy as the repo business itself: we take what's ours, and we do it legally. 🚗💨
